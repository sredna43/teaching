# I want you to quickly learn how to use the interpreter, this is (basically) what actually reads and runs python programs

# You can start the interpreter by opening a command window and typing: python


# Once the interpreter is running, try using it as a very basic calculator!

# Maybe try a print("hello") command too just for fun. The interpreter is nice for
# prototyping small chunks of code, but for entire programs, files are the way to go.

# To quit the interpreter, type quit() and hit enter.

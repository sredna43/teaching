# Hello Deidree! Welcome to your very first Python program :)

# All of these lines that start with # are called comments, and aren't actual code.

'''Triple quotes also work as comments,
and can span multiple lines'''



# Let's take a look at a super basic, starting function for python here:
print("Hello, world!")

# Here's your first challenge: I want this program, when executed, to say the following:

# Hello, world!
# My name is Python.

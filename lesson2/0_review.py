# In the last lesson, we went over some of the basics regarding the python programming language.
# Now, it's time to dig in a little bit deeper.

# However, before we get into that let's do a little bit of review! Here's a small series of exercises for you.

# Ex. 1: Fix the following code so that it runs, then test it!

# $my_str = "hello, world!"
# print($my_str)

# Ex. 2: Write a function that returns the product of two numbers


# Ex. 3: Write a function that takes in a number n as an argument and prints the numbers from n to 0 in descending order
# (ie. n = 5 then 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0)



# Ex. 4: Bonus!! Mad libs :)

# Here's how you take in user input:

my_input = input("Enter something: ")
print("You entered: " + my_input)

# Use this to create your very own mad libs! Make it however you want, and make it in a separate file!

# (If you're feeling like a good, lazy programmer, take a look at this example mad lib)
